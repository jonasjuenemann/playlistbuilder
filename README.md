This project represents a React app that works in conjunction with using the Spotify API. Tracks can be searched from the Spotify library and saved to a playlist. This playlist can in turn be automatically transferred to Spotify. The prerequisite for using the app is a functioning Spotify account. The login is then done via an OAuth2 procedure.
